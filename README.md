# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
I think that I did a good job with the formatting of this project. I took extra time out to make sure that this program would be visually pleasing to the user.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that I could include a way to repeat the program so it can continue to be used rather than having to restart each time. I also think that I could include more choices for users to make the program more in depth and interesting.
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I struggled at first writing the code, and I had to go through the zybooks chapters we learned in order to ensure that I was writing the functions correctly, and doing everything I could to ensure the security of the program was strong.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Considering this project used a lot of the basics of c++, I think that all of the skills would be transferable, because it was important to work on each and every one to get the code running properly. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to follow customs of coding, such as including in line comments to describe what I was doing. Because I have uploaded it to github, I can also ensure that I have access to the code, as well as others, so it can be worked on publically.
